## Prototype PCB:
 
### Pic A:
  
  Solid State Relay board 5V, and 12V jack for Magnetic Valves. 
  5/12V circuts are completely seperated. Powered by 5V/800mA USB, and 12V/1A (both DC) power supply.
  DONT power ESP32 board with USB, and additional supply in parallel. It will DESTROY the board!!!
